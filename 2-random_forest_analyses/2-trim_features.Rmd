```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message=FALSE,
                      autodep  = TRUE,
                      cache = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 5,

The feature library contains many features. We intend to train multiple random forest models as a first exploration to see if certain features influence HLA sampling. No make these models a little bit less heavy, we'll subset the features to a more manageable size. We'll filter based on their variance using the `caret` package


```{r loading}
library(here)
library(caret)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Initial trimming

## Import and inspect

```{r import_feats}
(feats <- read_tsv(file = here("Data", "Protein_per_Uniprot_entry_library_v2_RBP_GC_length_codon_AA_m6A_m5C_AtoI_m1A_m7G_CD8miRDB_PTM.csv")))

```


Lets have a look at the different types of features in the dataset. Feature names use "_" as interpunction. The broad categories of features seem to be stored in the last word of the feature name. Will extract that information and count the occurrences. 


```{r count_feat_types}
feat.names <- names(feats[-1])

feat.classes <- (c("UTR5","CDS" ,"UTR3","hsa",  "count"))

feat.classes %>% 
  map( ~str_subset(feat.names,.)) %>% 
  set_names(feat.classes) %>% 
  enframe %>% 
  mutate(count = map_dbl(value, length),
         name = factor(name, levels = feat.classes)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = (count), fill = name, label = count))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
    scale_y_log10()+
  theme_classic()+
  geom_text(nudge_y = 0.1)

ggsave(here("Figs", "trim_feature_counts.pdf"), width = 4, height = 3)



feat.classes %>% 
  map( ~str_subset(feat.names,.)) %>% 
  set_names(feat.classes) %>% 
  str()




```

Features corresponding to the 3' UTR, 5' UTR and CDS seem quite equal in numbers. Features ending in "count", appear to be protein related. m6a is a mRNA modification. 

## Calculate variance


We'll use `caret::nearZeroVar` to calculate the amount of variance across features. First convert the `NA` values to zero's. 


```{r calculate_variance, cache=TRUE}

feats %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), replace_na, 0 )) -> feats


variance.metrics <- nearZeroVar(feats[-1], saveMetrics = TRUE)

write_tsv(variance.metrics, here("Output", "variance_metrics.tsv"))

```

Now we have the variance metrics, lets have a look at them. First tidy the output table a bit. Move the names to a column, generate a feature.type column, and filter for the main types. 


```{r tidy_variance}
feat.classes <- str_sort(c("UTR5", "UTR3", "CDS", "count", "hsa"))

variance.metrics %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "feature") %>% 
  mutate(feature.type = case_when(str_detect(feature, "UTR5") ~ "UTR5",
                                  str_detect(feature, "UTR3") ~ "UTR3",
                                  str_detect(feature, "count") ~ "count",
                                  str_detect(feature, "CDS") ~ "CDS",
                                  str_detect(feature, "hsa") ~ "miR",
                                  TRUE ~ "misc"))  -> variance.metrics

variance.metrics %>% 
  count(feature.type)

variance.metrics %>% 
  filter(feature.type == "misc")
```

Now plot the frequency ratio. This indicates the ratio between the most common, and the second most common value. A lower value would indicate a more heterogeneous variable. 

```{r plot_freqRatio}
variance.metrics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = freqRatio))+ 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+
    facet_wrap(~feature.type, scales = "free_y")+
    scale_x_log10()+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 500, color = "red")
```

And the percentage of unique values within each variable, a lower value indicates a more homogeneous variable.

```{r plot_percentage}
variance.metrics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percentUnique))+ 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+
    facet_wrap(~feature.type, scales = "free_y")+
    scale_x_log10()+
    geom_vline(xintercept = .05, color = "blue")

```


Lets look what we would slice off with these cutoffs. 

```{r plot_both}
variance.metrics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = freqRatio, y =percentUnique ))+ 
    geom_point()+
    facet_wrap(~feature.type)+
    scale_x_log10()+
    scale_y_log10()+
    geom_vline(xintercept = 500, color = "red")+
    geom_hline(yintercept = .05, color = "blue")
```

## Set cutoffs and extract

If we adhere to these cutoffs we'll be left with a significantly reduced pool of features.


```{r count_features}
variance.metrics %>% 
  filter(feature.type %in% c("miR","count") | (freqRatio < 100 & percentUnique > 0.05) )  %>% 
  count(feature.type)

```

Let extract the selected features. Set the cutoffs (I kept all of the protein level modifications, as this was such a small set). In addition, I currently remove features that are directly protein related, i.e. codons, AAs. 

```{r extract_features}
# Just to show that these protein related features are in there
str_subset(variance.metrics$feature, "codon|amino|AA_length")

variance.metrics %>% 
  filter(feature.type %in% c("miR","count")  | (freqRatio < 500 & percentUnique > 0.05)) %>% 
  filter( !(feature %in% str_subset(feature, "codon|amino|AA_length")) ) %>% 
  filter(feature.type != "misc") %>% 
  group_by(feature.type) %>% 
  group_split() %>% 
  set_names(feat.classes) %>% 
  map(pull, feature) -> feature.list 

str(feature.list)
```

## Write data

And now we can write out these features as individual tables. Create a directory, and then use `purrr:map` to select the desired columns from the feats table, and finally used `purrr:map2` to write the resulting list of tibbles to there desired locations.

We can then use these tibbles for the randomforest model training.

```{r write_data}
dir.create(here("Output", "feature_files"))

feature.list %>% 
  map( ~select(feats, one_of(c("Entry", .))) ) %>% 
  map2( here("Output", "feature_files", paste0(names(.), "_features.tsv")) , write_tsv )
```
