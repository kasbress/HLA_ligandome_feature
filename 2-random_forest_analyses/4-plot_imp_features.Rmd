```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message=FALSE,

```

In these I analysis I'll try to visualize features that were identified to be important by the individually fitted randomforest models. 

```{r loading}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(rstatix)
library(tidytext)
```

## Import data and tidy

Import the peptides used to train the models, down-sample decoy peptides to the same amount as the MS-detected peptides (3389) for each tumor. 

```{r import_data}
train.peptides <- read_tsv(here("Output", "test_train_tables_new", "rf_train_peptides.tsv"))

train.peptides %>% 
  mutate(tumor = fct_recode(tumor, `SK-MEL-95` = "mel95", M026.X1 = "M026", NKIRTIL006 = "RTE")) -> train.peptides

train.peptides %>% 
  group_by(tumor, ligand) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(sample.size = c(13556,13556,13556, 3389, 3389, 3389)) %>% 
  mutate(data = map2(data, sample.size, sample_n)) %>% 
  select(-sample.size) %>% 
  unnest(data) -> train.peptides

train.peptides
```


Import the important features and the entire feature table.

The `imp.features` table contains the top features, based on summed importance score over the three lines. 

Features table contains a lot of `NA`'s, replace these with 0's, and select only the important features.


```{r import_features}
imp.features <- read_tsv(here("Output", "top_important_features.tsv"))

features <- read_tsv(here("Data", "Protein_per_Uniprot_entry_library_v2_RBP_GC_length_codon_AA_m6A_m5C_AtoI_m1A_m7G_CD8miRDB_PTM.csv"))

features %>% 
  select(one_of("Entry", imp.features$feature)) %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), replace_na, 0 )) -> features
```


select the top 10 features for each class.


```{r get_focus}
imp.features %>%
  group_by(classes) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = score, n = 10) %>% 
  pull(feature) -> focus.features 

focus.features
```

subset the feature table, join with the peptide table, switch to long, and add feature types

```{r tidy_data}
features %>%
  select(one_of("Entry", focus.features)) %>%  
  inner_join(train.peptides, by =  c("Entry" = "swissprot_id")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = one_of(focus.features), names_to = "feature", values_to = "value") %>%
  mutate(feature = factor(feature, levels = focus.features)) %>% 
  mutate(feature.type = case_when(str_detect(feature, "UTR5") ~ "UTR5",
                                  str_detect(feature, "UTR3") ~ "UTR3",
                                  str_detect(feature, "count") ~ "count",
                                  str_detect(feature, "CDS") ~ "CDS",
                                  str_detect(feature, "hsa") ~ "miR",
                                  TRUE ~ "misc")) -> plot.data

plot.data
```

## Boxplots

Plot the different features as boxplots, separated on MS-detected and decoy peptides.

```{r boxplots, fig.width=18, fig.asp=.8}
ggplot(plot.data, aes(x = tumor, y = value, fill = ligand))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free", ncol = 10)
```


## T test

To specifically select a couple features that are significantly associated with HLA sampling, we can do a simple t test. 

Plot the T statistics as barplots, either all together or facetted. 

```{r t_test, fig.width=12,fig.asp=.2 }
feat.classes <- (c("UTR5","CDS" ,"UTR3","hsa",  "count"))

plot.data %>% 
  group_by(feature) %>% 
  t_test(value~ligand) %>% 
  adjust_pvalue(method = "bonferroni") -> stats

stats


stats %>% 
  mutate(feature.type = case_when(str_detect(feature, "UTR5") ~ "UTR5",
                                  str_detect(feature, "UTR3") ~ "UTR3",
                                  str_detect(feature, "count") ~ "count",
                                  str_detect(feature, "CDS") ~ "CDS",
                                  str_detect(feature, "hsa") ~ "miR",
                                  TRUE ~ "misc"),
           feature = str_remove_all(feature, "UTR5|UTR3|CDS|count|hsa|\\."),
           feature = str_replace_all(feature, "_", " "),
           feature = reorder_within(feature, -statistic, feature.type)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = feature, y = -statistic, fill = p.adj < 0.05))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
    coord_flip()+
    scale_x_reordered()+
    theme_minimal()+
    facet_wrap(~feature.type, scales = "free_y", nrow = 1)

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_Tstat_facet.pdf"), width = 16, height = 2.8)
```


```{r T-test_plot, fig.asp=1, fig.width=8}
stats %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(feature, -statistic), y = -statistic, fill = p.adj < 0.05))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
    coord_flip()+
    theme_minimal()

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_Tstat_all.pdf"), width = 6, height = 7)
```

Next we can plot the top and bottom 10 features by t-statistic. 


```{r boxplots_significant, fig.width=15, fig.asp=.4}
stats %>% 
  filter(dense_rank(statistic) <= 10 | dense_rank(desc(statistic)) <= 10) %>% 
  pull(feature) %>% 
  fct_drop() -> feats

plot.data %>% 
  filter(feature %in% feats) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(tumor, log10(value+1), fill = ligand))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, nrow = 2, scales = "free")+
  theme_classic()

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_boxplots.pdf"), width = 12, height = 4, scale = 1.5)
```


## HLA ligand enrichment

Was looking for other ways to visualize whether the values of a feature would allow one to enrich for MS detected peptides. One way to do this could be to count the amount of HLA ligands present in the top 50% peptides after sorting for each feature. As a control, I can calculate the same metric after randomly permuting that feature. I can subsequently plot the difference between the actual and control setting.

Achieved this with the bit of code below; Adding a column where each feature is permuted, and a column of random values which I can use later on for tie breaking. Then nest to get separate tibbles for each feature and tumor. Then arrange these tibbles by feature value and tie-breaker, slice off 50% of the columns, calculate the amount of HLA ligands, and pull those values. Do the sample for the permuted control column. 


bootstrapped this analysis. I added some lines to subset 30% of the data during each loop.


```{r calculate_PPV}
df.list <- list()
for(i in 1:50){
  plot.data %>% 
    select(ligand, feature, value, tumor, feature.type) %>% 
    group_by(feature, tumor, feature.type) %>%
    mutate(random = sample(value, n()),
           for.arrange = 1:n()) %>% 
    nest() %>%          
    mutate(PPV = map(data, ~sample_frac(., size = .3)),
           control = PPV,
           PPV = map(PPV, ~arrange(., desc(value))),
           PPV = map(PPV, ~slice_head(.,prop =  .5)),
           PPV = map(PPV, ~summarise(., PPV = sum(ligand))),
           PPV = map_dbl(PPV, pull, PPV),
           control = map(control, ~arrange(., desc(random))),
           control = map(control, ~slice_head(.,prop =  .5)),
           control = map(control, ~summarise(., PPV = sum(ligand))),
           control = map_dbl(control, pull, PPV)) %>%
    mutate(difference = PPV-control,
           perc.difference = ((PPV-control)/control)*100) %>% 
    rename_with(~paste0(., i), contains("difference")) %>% 
    select(!c(data, PPV, control)) -> PPV.data
  
  df.list[[i]] <- PPV.data
}

PPV.data <- reduce(df.list, inner_join, by = c("feature", "tumor", "feature.type"))
```


Plot that data as bar plot, and each individual run as points. 

```{r plot_PPV_dots, fig.width=15, fig.asp=.25}
PPV.data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("perc."), names_to = "replicate", values_to = "difference") %>% 
  group_by(feature.type) %>% 
  group_split() -> to.plot

map(to.plot, ~ggplot(., aes(x = tumor, y = difference, fill = tumor))+
                geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "summary", fun = "median")+
                geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge() )+
                facet_wrap(~feature, nrow = 1))
```


Or plot as barplot, adding the the confidence interval.


```{r plot_PPV_error, fig.width=14, fig.asp=.35}
PPV.data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("perc."), names_to = "replicate", values_to = "diff") %>% 
  group_by(feature, feature.type, tumor) %>% 
  summarise(difference = mean(diff), stdev = sd(diff), n=n()) %>% 
  mutate(se = stdev/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(ic = se * qt((1-0.05)/2 + .5, n-1)) %>% 
  group_by(feature, feature.type) %>% 
  mutate(group.mean = mean(difference)) %>% 
  mutate(feature.label = str_replace_all(feature, "_", " "),
         feature.label = str_remove(feature.label, feature.type),
         feature = reorder_within(feature, group.mean, feature.type)) -> to.plot

ggplot(to.plot, aes(x = reorder(feature, group.mean), y = difference, fill = tumor,  
                    ymin=difference-ic, ymax=difference+ic))+
  geom_bar( stat="identity", color = "black", position = "dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(  position=position_dodge(width=0.9), width = .3)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  facet_wrap(~feature.type, scales = "free", nrow =1)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_x_reordered()+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line())

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_enrichment_final.pdf"), width = 150, height = 35, units = "mm", scale = 2.5)
```

Plot the mean difference from each feature as a measure of importance of each feature class.


```{r compare_imp1}
library(scales)
to.plot %>% 
  group_by(feature, feature.type) %>% 
  summarise(mean.difference = mean(difference)) %>% 
  mutate(feature = paste0(feature, feature.type)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(feature, mean.difference), mean.difference, fill = feature.type))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = extended_breaks(n = 6))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line())

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_enrichment_classes_final.pdf"), width = 5, height = 3)
```


```{r compare_imp2}
to.plot %>% 
  group_by(feature, feature.type) %>% 
  summarise(mean.difference = mean(difference)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(feature.type, abs(mean.difference)), abs(mean.difference), color = feature.type))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, size = 1)+
  geom_jitter(width = .15, color = "black")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line())

ggsave(here("Figs", "importance_enrichment_classes_box_final.pdf"), width = 4, height = 3)

```
